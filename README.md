# Izabela Sawicka sample documentation
I'm a sesoned technical writer with almost nine years of experience in IT software projects. I was working for a variety of businesses like:
* ERP
* Telecommunication
* Graph analysis and data
* Manufacturing and automation
  
I cannot share the results of my work with these companies because they are copyrighted by the companies. That is why I'm working on this Github project.
